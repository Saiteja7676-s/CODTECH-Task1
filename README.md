# Overview of the Project

Project Title: Password Strength Checker

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a tool that evaluates the strength of passwords provided by users. The tool aims to improve user awareness and security by offering feedback on password quality, helping them create more secure and resilient passwords.

Key Activities

Designing algorithms to assess password strength based on various factors such as length, complexity (use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and uniqueness.

Implementing feedback mechanisms to guide users toward creating stronger passwords.

Conducting tests to ensure that the tool accurately rates password strength and provides meaningful suggestions.

Technology Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Regular expressions (re),  hashlib for hashing comparisons

Development Environment: Visual Studio Code
